# MovieReview

• The site we wrote is a movie review site. Before watching a movie, users will come to the site and look at the comments of other viewers about the movie, and we will ask the people who make additional comments to give the movie a score out of 5. The user who comes to get general information about the movie will be able to understand whether the movie is liked or not based on the score it receives.

• Since I am writing the backend part of this project, the technologies I generally use in the project are; I used Node.js, express.js, mongoDB, JWT Token, mongoose and bcrypt encryption technology.
